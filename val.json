P. 615 in handwriting of Dr George Witt. Begins p. 1: \"On fevers attending injuries. Medicine is in itself one and indivisible; it is a science which has for its object the cure of diseases in general.\" Ends p. 241: (lect XXX). \"I have here given a mere outline of surgery, as I know it to be impossible to teach it by lectures - facts and fine reasonings may be rendered so mawkish by dilution as to become tiresome and disgusting - I see no good in lecturing to people when they are asleep & after all the utmost extent that lectures can do, is to send us out to practice with minds prepared to meditate and to observe. I consider myself in the light of a topographer, as one who has travelled & is describing the country to others, who does not mention every hedge, gate & puddle where we may dirty our boots, but who points out where good accomodation may be had & where we may rest in peace.\" Followed by: \"Surgical extracts from Mr Abernethy's anatomical lectures; delivered 1820.\" Begins p. 242: \"On the blood. In considering the subject of animal matter, I shall follow Haller's division.\" Ends p. 386: \"In the horse, the carotid arteries pursue a very tortuous course down the neck, and before they enter the skull.\" Followed by about a hundred blank leaves. At the end of the volume is a \"General Index\" (5 pp.) and an \"Index to Mr Abernethy's surgical lectures\" (p. 1) The text differs considerably from that of any of the published lectures. On the last page is the following declaration: \"We the undersigned who have been permitted to take a copy of the foregoing Lectures of the late Mr Abernethy hereby promise and agree in the most unequivocal manner that we will never allow any person to take a copy without first obtaining the sanction of Dr Witt, in testimony whereof we have hereunto subscribed our respective names.\" Signed in 1835 by Wm. Thurnall, Matthew Inman, Richard Henry Meade, James Edman Beveridge, Goerge Dixon Hedley, Charles Longuet Higgins, Charles Frederick Edwards and Thomas Mitchell, and in 1843 by W.R. Nusham. The declaration is in Dr George Witt's handwriting, probably Charles' brother. Note: Charles Witt studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital, qualified MRCS in 1821 and became an extra-licentiate of the RCP in 1841. He was House Surgeon to the General Infirmary, Northampton, and died 23 April 1883, aged 86. George Witt graduated M.D. at Leyden in 1828, and was for some time a surgeon in the service of the Hon. East India Co. On his return to England, he became in 1845 an extra-licentiate of the RCP, and obtained the post of physician to the Bedford General Infirmary."
