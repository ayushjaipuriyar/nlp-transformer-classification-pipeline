I., in a low inner parlor, did fall at strife with the said Richard Waterman, his wife and two daughters, who would have put him out of doors, but he set his back against the door and resisted. During the struggle there was an outcry by the daughters, \"He will spoile my father, he will murder my father,\" whereupon Thomas Waterman, who was sitting with Humphry Acton by the fire in the chimney in the hall right opposite the parlor door, forced it open, and seizing Gilbert by the collar of his doublet, essayed to put him out; but the latter, having drawn a long knife, stabbed him in the right side by the navel, whereof he died the same night. The jurors are extremely particular in minuti\u00e6 as to the depth and width of the wound, the length and price of the knife, & c",

This volume is made up of three parts: Part one is the Ephemeris Botanica which includes detailed descriptions of plants, written in Latin; it includes some sketches and ranges from 15 December 1800 to 24 September 1823. The title of part two is 'Memorandum relating to Herbaria of Portugal, Madeira, Tenerife and Brazil' and it documents the labelling and packaging details following the collection of the plants. There is a description which says, 'The Brazilian Herbarium (including those of Portugal, Madeira and Tenerife) collected between 25 March 1825 (arrival at Lisbon) and 10 February 1830 (sailing from Par\u00e1) was begun to be unpacked at Fulham on 3 February 1847 and ended on 15 February 1850'. There are pages of data in tabulated form under the headings: parcel or package number; number of the Catal. Geog; country or place where collected; date when each parcel was unpacked. 133 packages are included in this table. The next list describes the 'state in which the specimens were found to be at the time when they were unpacked at Fulham from Feb 1847 to Feb 1850'. Following this is 'An account of the quantity of paper finally used after unpacking the Brazilian Herbarium from Feb 1847 to Feb 1850'. There is then an account of the system used to affix labels to the specimens in the Brazilian Herbarium. Another table lists the specimens which are missing and further list shows the number of specimens counted in the Herbarium. Part three of this volume is called 'A Catalogue of Bulbous Roots brought from Southern Africa'. The list shows how many bulbs he had of each variety from 12 March 1816 and shows when they flowered. It continues to 10 October 1826. There is a table showing 'Bulbs in the borders as they stand in succession' and finally a list documenting the bulbs which were given away, showing the date, name of the recipient and the bulb number.",

The first folio after the title page is a copy of Bowie's commission as Collector for Kew Gardens, dated 9 September 1814 from George Harrison at the Treasury Chambers. The remaining folios (numbered 1-413) are entitled 'Journal kept By James Bowie'. The first part of the journal relates to Bowie's expedition to Brazil with Allan Cunningham 1814-1816. The journal's first dated entry is 30 December 1814 but contains a summary of their journey from 3 October 1814 with embarkation on the HMS Duncan at Spithead, finally disembarking in Rio de Janeiro on 29 December 1814. Bowie parted company with Cunningham on 1 August 1816 when he left for Porto da Estrella from where he progressed to Corgo Secco (?) which he made a base, collecting in the area, until Cunningham rejoined him. Bowie embarked on the Mulgrave Castle on 27 August and sailed on 28 August, anchoring in Table Bay on the Cape on 30 August. The rest of the journal covers a number of shorter expeditions from his home near Cape Town, one to Knysna (c early Nov 1818-12 Mar 1819) and other trips from 22 May 1819-1 Aug 1819 and circa 8 Sept 1819-29 Jan 1821. He travelled again from 25 May 1821 and the journal finishes on 30 September 1821 while he appears to still be on expedition."

Thomas Marwood is traditionally stated to have been for some time about the Court of James I, to have been along with the physicians in ordinary in attendance on the king during his last illness, and present at the examination of his body after death; and to be the author of the account mentioned above.\" Sir Edward Marwood, Bart who owned the MS previous to Dr. Munk has made the following note on the inside of the cover: \"This book belonged to Dr. Marwood anno 1615. He attended James I in his last illness, 1625. At the end of this vol. is a relation of the last Illness of this Monarch and also a Post-Mortem examination of the Body.\" Dr. William Munk, who made an exhaustive study of the MS. doubted the authorship of Dr. Marwood, and rather favoured the suggestion that \"the volume is really neither more nor less than the daily entry book of a leading and fashionable Apothecary in London, containing the copies in extenso of the prescriptions he compounded for the physicians who patronised and the persons who employed him. He may even have been \"Apothecary to the Person.\" As such he would have been in immediate attendance on the king, as glysters and cupping had to be employed. Or lastly, the report of the illness and of the post-mortem examination may have been merely copied by the writer of the volume from the notes of one of the many physicians who were present throughout. It is clear that the author of the report was a medical man, and one thoroughly conversant with the habits of the king and the king and the whole course of his illness. The full account has been printed by Dr. Munk in his \"Manvodia\" (The Genealogist, 1885)"

      "text": "The Register of the Gild of the Holy Cross the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist of Stratford upon Avon The Register is a folio volume of paper containing 178 numbered leaves, with two unnumbered folios of introductory matter. The paper is uniform throughout and bears an unidentified watermark consisting of three pendent lobes within a circle: the leaves measure 15\u00bc by 10\u00bd inches The first 80 folios are carefully written in the same hand, a single column to a page enclosed by a ruled border of red lines They contain apparently a transcript of an earlier register now lost. The year headings and the names of officials elected are written larger than the other entries. The work is continued in a similar hand to fol.cxxxvij, with the exception of a few entries added by a different scribe, but from this point the entries are contemporary and are written in various hands The volume still retains its original binding of oak boards covered with leather, blind-tooled. It was made in 1488-9, in which year the Gild paid 2s.1Od, for the binding: 'Et solutum pro ligacione unius libri vocati le Reyester, ijs.xd.' It was originally fastened by metal clasps, but when the volume was described by Thomas Fisher in 1835 it was 'secured by strong silk ties', but the volume has since 1864 been rebacked and repaired and the silk ties replaced by flimsy brass clasps, one of which is lost The binding which is now somewhat worn and rubbed has been identified as the work of an Oxford bookbinder. The panel of blind-tooling consists of a central row of ten heraldic roses, each within a circle, the whole group surrounded by a border of square stamps representing a monster with a bearded head and bushy tail; outside this is a border of square stamps representing a monster with two heads, one bearded wearing a fool's cap, the other dragon-like; and this is surrounded by four lines ruled to cross one another at the corners. Outside these lines is a border of square stamps in the form of griffins, each stamp being in a foliated circle, and these in turn are surrounded by three ruled lines, and another set of four ruled lines running round the edges of the cover The following imperfections in the volume are noted. Portions, varying in depth from a narrow strip to almost half a page have been cut or torn from the bottom of the following folios: 15,112,121,137,155,162,170. In all cases the paper removed was probably blank, except f.121 where some of the text has been lost Single leaves have been cut out (before the volume was foliated) after folios 17,82,137,138,141,157,165 and 177, while two leaves have been cut out after folios 139,146,149 and 151 Contents: ff.i-ii 'The Constitucyons and ordinauncys for the good gouernaunce and rewle of the Gilde of the Holy Cros, owre Lady and Seynt John the Baptist of Stratford vppon Auene made and ordeynyd the Monday next after the fest 8 July 1443] of {the translacion of Seynt Thomas the Martir} the yere reyn of Kynge Harry the sixte aftur the conquest the xxjti to be vsyd and had from this day forewardis' Further ordinances regarding the granting of leases and the appointment of any priest or schoolmaster were added on 21 May, 1500 f.iivo.

VII, 'John Salburge of Allescote is elected master', 1507-8] and on the verso a similar list for 23 Hen. VII, with John Salburge again elected master These entries are puzzling as they do not tally with those of the corresponding years in the Register itself. The admission of John Salbrugge of Wyllycote is recorded in 12 Edw.IV, (1472-3) but his name does not occur elsewhere in the Register In the margin of f.178vo. is the impression of a circular stamp containing a cross patonce between four cinquefoils Loosely inserted at the end of the volume are two leaves of watermarked paper, containing 'The names of the cheife benefactors to the Gilde of Stretford as also in what yere of the Lord, and reigne of the Kinges of Englande, they were admitted into the brotherhood of the said Gild' Dated 1605"

      "content": "In libros aliquot Pauli Acginetae hypomnemata quedem, see observationes medicamentorum. The author's manuscript copy of the above, presented to Sir Walter Mildmay in 1588. The MS begins with six lines in Latin verse, followed by a Greek version, also in six lines. On the next page is the Latin dedication to Sir Walter Mildmay. The work consists of short comments on various passages of Paulus Aegineta. The Greek preface of the printed edition does not appear in the MS. nor do the paragraphs at the end on the treatment of a woman with gout. On the first leaf is printed a small piece of paper on which is written: 'The Earl of Westmoreland, 1856.\" The Earl's country seat was Apethorpe, which he inherited from Francis Fane, who married the daughter and heiress of Sir Anthony Mildmay, eldest son of Sir Walter Mildmay. Thus the manuscript which Etherege sent to Mildmay in 1588 came to belong to the Earl of Westmoreland, who died in 1859. The MS is bound in vellum, and has on each side a shield with the arms of Queen Elizabeth. The Royal Arms were used because Sir Walter Mildmay was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Inside the front cover is the book plate of Dr. Frank Payne, who bequeathed this book to the College. (For further particulars, see \"A Memorial of George Edrych and his friends in our College, 1518-1588,\" by Sir Norman Moore.) (F.1) Latin epigram. 10 lines inc.

Medicine is in itself one and indivisible; it is a science which has for its object the cure of diseases in general.\" Ends p. 241: (lect XXX). \"I have here given a mere outline of surgery, as I know it to be impossible to teach it by lectures - facts and fine reasonings may be rendered so mawkish by dilution as to become tiresome and disgusting - I see no good in lecturing to people when they are asleep & after all the utmost extent that lectures can do, is to send us out to practice with minds prepared to meditate and to observe. I consider myself in the light of a topographer, as one who has travelled & is describing the country to others, who does not mention every hedge, gate & puddle where we may dirty our boots, but who points out where good accomodation may be had & where we may rest in peace.\" Followed by: \"Surgical extracts from Mr Abernethy's anatomical lectures; delivered 1820.\" Begins p. 242: \"On the blood. In considering the subject of animal matter, I shall follow Haller's division.\" Ends p. 386: \"In the horse, the carotid arteries pursue a very tortuous course down the neck, and before they enter the skull.\" Followed by about a hundred blank leaves. At the end of the volume is a \"General Index\" (5 pp.) and an \"Index to Mr Abernethy's surgical lectures\" (p. 1) The text differs considerably from that of any of the published lectures. On the last page is the following declaration: \"We the undersigned who have been permitted to take a copy of the foregoing Lectures of the late Mr Abernethy hereby promise and agree in the most unequivocal manner that we will never allow any person to take a copy without first obtaining the sanction of Dr Witt, in testimony whereof we have hereunto subscribed our respective names.\" Signed in 1835 by Wm. Thurnall, Matthew Inman, Richard Henry Meade, James Edman Beveridge, Goerge Dixon Hedley, Charles Longuet Higgins, Charles Frederick Edwards and Thomas Mitchell, and in 1843 by W.R. Nusham. The declaration is in Dr George Witt's handwriting, probably Charles' brother. Note: Charles Witt studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital, qualified MRCS in 1821 and became an extra-licentiate of the RCP in 1841. He was House Surgeon to the General Infirmary, Northampton, and died 23 April 1883, aged 86. George Witt graduated M.D. at Leyden in 1828, and was for some time a surgeon in the service of the Hon. East India Co. On his return to England, he became in 1845 an extra-licentiate of the RCP, and obtained the post of physician to the Bedford General Infirmary."

      "content": "[John Roiffey (Roiffy, Roiffee)] (The writer can be identified by his remark that he was given the governor's clothes from his wardrobe, a circumstance which is mentioned in a letter of 17 June 1697 where the recipient is named, and also from other remarks. The spelling of his name is very uncertain.) to [Lord Orford]. Letter. Just before Col. Francis's death everyone forced his way into the chamber, and the writer thought fit to remove some gold and silver objects to the wardrobe for safety. Mr. Langley began to intimate that he knew where the will was to be found in the closet, and that he had been made deputy governor. Early in the morning the Colonel died and Major Garth and Capt. Payne wanted their seals put on the closet until the council was informed, but Langley would only apply his own, which he broke the next morning to enter with Col. Bishop and his wife on pretence of looking for the will. Various things happened and the writer, finding everything in disorder, sent privately to the council, who sent men to seal the closet and set sentries at the door, later removing papers, money, plate etc. It has since been proved that Langley took several things of value, and also some letters from a married gentlewoman for whom the Colonel had a great esteem, which he showed about. Langley was given the administration, and came to Fontabelle where, with Mr. Mozeley and some other company he spent several weeks consuming the provisions which were left. He sent for Mozely's wife, children and servants, and his own servants. Some creditors he turned away, and to others/offered bills of exchange on his own estate or his pay in England, saying that he would keep the governor's estate to improve it by merchandising, to which end he had a ship's master staying and planned to buy a ship and start trading. He began to speak slightingly of the Col., and demanded the money which his securities had taken away or he would not pay the creditors or the servants. The securities presented a petition to the council on account of maladministration, and the servants swore to what they knew I had been embezzled, but the administration was not taken from him. Langley and Mozeley suspected the writer of spying and turned him out, Langley saying that he would shoot him if he saw him there, so he came to town with no possessions and petitioned the council for relief, who were sympathetic but unable to help. He then went to sea as surgeon of the Newcastle, having persuaded the housekeeper to remain at Fontabelle to keep watch, and on returning heard that his Lordship had sent a power of attorney to Major Garth and Mr. Fullerton, at whose request he went to Fontabelle until the goods were sold. Langley had not expected such disappointment, having been sure of being continued as administrator, and had said that his lordship was rich enough to give him the estate. Commissioners were appointed to regulate all affairs, and the servants gave evidence before them as to what had been disposed of, though other things could not be sworn to, such as a diamond ring worth about 80 gns. Mr. Langley went to live with Mozeley, the principal promoter of all the irregularities, whose wife left the island with \u00a3200 in bills of exchange. The writer has never received a farthing for subsistance, though he was given the governor's clothes. He affirms all this to be true. Mention is also made of Woodraff, Mrs. Moore, Mr. Cocteux. Endorsed 'The Freuchomans accompt'."

The unpleasantness of making the declaration before a Master Extraordinary in Chancery or a Justice of the Peace had deterred her. It would make no difference. A declaration by the Hon. Mrs. Portman would be far better. He expected a reply to a letter he had written her. If her reply was favourable he would send her a declaration to make, or would go to her. He had no fear of the result of the present treaty if he took sufficiently strong declarations to the solicitors, but he must not take any which required explanation. He had not submitted the drafts of the declarations to the solicitors and the event, both with Mrs. Hind and the Countess, had shown the prudence of this. He had had the possibility of proceedings after Mr. Knight's father's death in view through all this business, but with a somewhat different view of it, namely that the greatest possible care should be taken in framing any declaration to be made by anyone who might be called as a witness in those proceedings, so that what was now declared should be stated as clearly and strongly as possible, lest a weak declaration made now should be quoted against testimony to be made in Mr. Knight's favour later. Signed: Archd. White."
