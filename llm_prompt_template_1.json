This volume is made up of three parts: Part one is the Ephemeris Botanica which includes detailed descriptions of plants, written in Latin; it includes some sketches and ranges from 15 December 1800 to 24 September 1823. The title of part two is 'Memorandum relating to Herbaria of Portugal, Madeira, Tenerife and Brazil' and it documents the labelling and packaging details following the collection of the plants. There is a description which says, 'The Brazilian Herbarium (including those of Portugal, Madeira and Tenerife) collected between 25 March 1825 (arrival at Lisbon) and 10 February 1830 (sailing from Par\u00e1) was begun to be unpacked at Fulham on 3 February 1847 and ended on 15 February 1850'. There are pages of data in tabulated form under the headings: parcel or package number; number of the Catal. Geog; country or place where collected; date when each parcel was unpacked. 133 packages are included in this table. The next list describes the 'state in which the specimens were found to be at the time when they were unpacked at Fulham from Feb 1847 to Feb 1850'. Following this is 'An account of the quantity of paper finally used after unpacking the Brazilian Herbarium from Feb 1847 to Feb 1850'. There is then an account of the system used to affix labels to the specimens in the Brazilian Herbarium. Another table lists the specimens which are missing and further list shows the number of specimens counted in the Herbarium. Part three of this volume is called 'A Catalogue of Bulbous Roots brought from Southern Africa'. The list shows how many bulbs he had of each variety from 12 March 1816 and shows when they flowered. It continues to 10 October 1826. There is a table showing 'Bulbs in the borders as they stand in succession' and finally a list documenting the bulbs which were given away, showing the date, name of the recipient and the bulb number.\n\nDecide which museum the above record should be in from the choices below.\n\n0: National Maritime Museum\n1: National Railway Museum\n2: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew\n3: Royal College of Physicians of London\n4: Shakespeare Birthplace Trust",

The first folio after the title page is a copy of Bowie's commission as Collector for Kew Gardens, dated 9 September 1814 from George Harrison at the Treasury Chambers. The remaining folios (numbered 1-413) are entitled 'Journal kept By James Bowie'. The first part of the journal relates to Bowie's expedition to Brazil with Allan Cunningham 1814-1816. The journal's first dated entry is 30 December 1814 but contains a summary of their journey from 3 October 1814 with embarkation on the HMS Duncan at Spithead, finally disembarking in Rio de Janeiro on 29 December 1814. Bowie parted company with Cunningham on 1 August 1816 when he left for Porto da Estrella from where he progressed to Corgo Secco (?) which he made a base, collecting in the area, until Cunningham rejoined him. Bowie embarked on the Mulgrave Castle on 27 August and sailed on 28 August, anchoring in Table Bay on the Cape on 30 August. The rest of the journal covers a number of shorter expeditions from his home near Cape Town, one to Knysna (c early Nov 1818-12 Mar 1819) and other trips from 22 May 1819-1 Aug 1819 and circa 8 Sept 1819-29 Jan 1821. He travelled again from 25 May 1821 and the journal finishes on 30 September 1821 while he appears to still be on expedition.\n\nDecide which museum the above record should be in from the choices below.\n\n0: National Maritime Museum\n1: National Railway Museum\n2: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew\n3: Royal College of Physicians of London\n4: Shakespeare Birthplace Trust",

The work is continued in a similar hand to fol.cxxxvij, with the exception of a few entries added by a different scribe, but from this point the entries are contemporary and are written in various hands The volume still retains its original binding of oak boards covered with leather, blind-tooled. It was made in 1488-9, in which year the Gild paid 2s.1Od, for the binding: 'Et solutum pro ligacione unius libri vocati le Reyester, ijs.xd.' It was originally fastened by metal clasps, but when the volume was described by Thomas Fisher in 1835 it was 'secured by strong silk ties', but the volume has since 1864 been rebacked and repaired and the silk ties replaced by flimsy brass clasps, one of which is lost The binding which is now somewhat worn and rubbed has been identified as the work of an Oxford bookbinder. The panel of blind-tooling consists of a central row of ten heraldic roses, each within a circle, the whole group surrounded by a border of square stamps representing a monster with a bearded head and bushy tail; outside this is a border of square stamps representing a monster with two heads, one bearded wearing a fool's cap, the other dragon-like; and this is surrounded by four lines ruled to cross one another at the corners. Outside these lines is a border of square stamps in the form of griffins, each stamp being in a foliated circle, and these in turn are surrounded by three ruled lines, and another set of four ruled lines running round the edges of the cover The following imperfections in the volume are noted. Portions, varying in depth from a narrow strip to almost half a page have been cut or torn from the bottom of the following folios: 15,112,121,137,155,162,170. In all cases the paper removed was probably blank, except f.121 where some of the text has been lost Single leaves have been cut out (before the volume was foliated) after folios 17,82,137,138,141,157,165 and 177, while two leaves have been cut out after folios 139,146,149 and 151 Contents: ff.i-ii 'The Constitucyons and ordinauncys for the good gouernaunce and rewle of the Gilde of the Holy Cros, owre Lady and Seynt John the Baptist of Stratford vppon Auene made and ordeynyd the Monday next after the fest 8 July 1443] of {the translacion of Seynt Thomas the Martir} the yere reyn of Kynge Harry the sixte aftur the conquest the xxjti to be vsyd and had from this day forewardis' Further ordinances regarding the granting of leases and the appointment of any priest or schoolmaster were added on 21 May, 1500 f.iivo.

Thus the manuscript which Etherege sent to Mildmay in 1588 came to belong to the Earl of Westmoreland, who died in 1859. The MS is bound in vellum, and has on each side a shield with the arms of Queen Elizabeth. The Royal Arms were used because Sir Walter Mildmay was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
