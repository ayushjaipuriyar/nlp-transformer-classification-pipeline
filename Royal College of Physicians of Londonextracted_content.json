            "content": "The British Railways (Western Region) signalling collection. This collection, acquired by the NRM in 1997, features signalling on British Railways Western Region, the lines previously served by the GWR. Covering Wales, the West Country and the Midlands, the photographs depict permanent way equipment, staff at work, lifting barriers, level crossings, marshalling yards, stations, control panels, signal box interiors, relay rooms and the signals themselves. These themes are repeated in the 35mm slides and lanternslides, but images of circuit diagrams feature more prominently, as do close-ups of the workings of signals. A handwritten register gives details of the subject and negative number. Prints are ordered by location and listed in the registers by place."

Photographs once sold by Railprint appear on their list P14. The LMS collection is listed in a handwritten register, with reference prints available for consultation in the Reading Room."
